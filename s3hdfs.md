# Cloud Storage Layer (AWS s3) as HDFS
* The hadoop and cloud storage vendors worked together in such a way that Cloud Storage Layer cna be treated as HDFS.
## Lab1.2: Using HDFS Commands(S3) 
* [Create an s3 bucket](https://github.com/dhagesharayu/Cloud_Computing/blob/Services/S3.md), [EMR with sqoop setup](https://github.com/dhagesharayu/Bigdatalab/blob/study/lab2.md) and [perform SSH on it](https://github.com/dhagesharayu/Bigdatalab/blob/study/EMRSetup%20with%20Hadoop.md)
